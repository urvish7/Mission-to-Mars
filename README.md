# Mission-to-Mars
Mongodb Learning

## Purpose of the Project:

The Robin's web app that is created during this module it looks good and functioning well. however, she likes to add more polish to it. She was admiring images of the Mars's hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She is interested in modifying the current web app to include all the four of the hemisphere images. 
To appoach this we will use Beautifulsoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of the Mars's hemisphere and the title of those images, store the scraped data on the Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, the alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
